                                    <h4>Project 1</h4>
                                    During this project we have made a boardgame. In this way we have learned to work together using the SCRUM-method. By using this method we have shared the workload equally. We have finished this project succesfully with a score 9 out of 10.
                                    <img src="images/Project1.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h4>Project 2</h4>
                                    In this project we have learned how to make a computer game using Python and Pygame. The cooperation went well thanks to the Scrum-method. We also have learned using Github and the project helped us to understand gamelogic better.
                                    <img src="images/project2.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                    <h4>Project 3</h4>
                                    In this project we made a database containing the average income and crime rate per region of Rotterdam. This way it was possible to compare crime against income. In this project we have learned how to use SQL and Java.
                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                    <h4>Project 4</h4>
                                    In this project we have made an android app. The app showed all kinds of graphs like how many bikes are stolen per region in Rotterdam or how many bike containers were placed per region in Rotterdam. The app could also locate your position and make appointments in another calander app.
                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                    <h4>Project 5 & 6</h4>
                                    
                                    In this project we have made a webstore. In this webstore you could do the same stuff as you would be able to do in any other webstore. You could add products to your favorites or to the shopping cart. The admin could see the statistics of the products and customers, ban accounts and reset passwords. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Developing the back end I mostly used Java, Velocity and SQL. While developing the front end I mostly used HTML and JavaScript.

									My name is Wouter Kettlitz, I am 22 years old, I am the youngest child in a family with 3 children. I was raised in a village called "Bergschenhoek". The first highschool I went to was called "The Laurenscollege", however I did not like this school so I went to "The Toorop Mavo". Here I got my degree.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Afterwards I went to study engineering at a community college, however I did not like this study and decided to quit after one year.
                                    Without being totally sure what to do, I decided to get a higher highschool degree. I studied at "VAVO Rijnmond College" for two years, my selectable subjects were Advanced mathamatics(Wiskunde B), physics, chemistry, biology and economy.<br><br>
                                    
                                    After getting my second degree, I decided to study computer science at Hogeschool Rotterdam. The main reason is my interest in the working of computers and programs.
                                    <br><br>
                                    My Hobby's are gaming, fixing problems concerning digital devices and going to the gym. My main interest within my education is artificial intelligence(AI), because besides computers the human brain is also very interesting and it seems to be very complex.
